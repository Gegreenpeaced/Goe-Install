## Goe-Install
First initial beta release up for testing.


## Usage
To use either download and start (maybe you need to do a `chmod +x install.sh` on the skript) or do a `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gegreenpeaced/Goe-Install/refs/heads/main/linux-installer/install.sh | bash.`

## Known Bugs
When pc-client is open, window is not scalable under Fedora 43 Workstation (prob. a xwayland Bug)
