## Goe-Install
First initial beta release up for testing.

Please report issues!

## Usage
To use either download and start (maybe you need to do a `chmod +x install.sh` on the skript) or do a `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gegreenpeaced/Goe-Install/refs/heads/main/linux-installer/install.sh | bash.`
